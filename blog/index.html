  <p><em>Motivations </em>
  <p>TLDR: this blog could be a miscellany of things, including neuroscience, me, and maybe a combination. </p>

 </header>
    <article>

  <p>I have always enjoyed reading and writing and thought I would pursue a degree in comparative literature. During my high school years, I stumbled upon books by Oliver Sacks and other science fiction works that delved into brain-computer interactions. Intrigued by these ideas, I decided to pursue neuroscience as my major field of study, with psychology and computer science serving as complementary tools and perspectives.
  <br> 
    <p>The transition from literature to science surprised those who had known me since childhood, and I have spent considerable time seeking a deeper understanding of why I embarked on this scientific path. It was during one of the lunch sessions with seminar speakers at Hopkins Neuroscience that I believe I found an answer. <a href='https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/directory/catherine-dulac/'>Dr. Catherine DuLac</a>, in a conversation, drew parallels between her initial fascination with fiction—specifically how the motives of different characters drive the plot—and the molecular interactions that shape social behaviors in mice. Although I may not recall her exact words, this quote resonated with me, becoming my hidden motivation to explore how distributed neural circuits across multiple brain regions coordinate activity and communicate with each other, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the world.
  <br>
  <p>By enrolling in a writing class taught by <a href='http://davidlinden.org/'>Dr. David Linden</a>, I honed my skills in conveying scientific research in a clear and accessible manner. I realized that scientific writing, too, is a process of unraveling relationships between characters—where concepts and findings take center stage—and connecting them to the world. Through this blog, I aspire to practice the art of breaking down complex scientific ideas into engaging written pieces.
  <br>
  <p>During my college years, I made room in my schedule for classes such as media analysis and digital anthropology. I also took the lead in a project that aimed to recreate anthropology artifacts in virtual reality. These experiences provided me with the opportunity to develop multimedia skills and express myself through various mediums. As someone deeply passionate about science communication, I hope to utilize these skills to present my research in compelling ways.
  <br>
  <p>Additionally, I would like to dedicate these blogs to the Asian and other international student communities. They have been a source of courage and strength for me, particularly during my studies abroad amid the current political tensions. Writing in my mother language allows me to express myself most accurately and brings me profound inner peace. As a result, some of the blogs will be presented in Chinese, accompanied by an English abstract.
